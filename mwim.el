;;; Commentary:

;; MWIM stands for "Move Where I Mean".  This package is inspired by
;; <http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BackToIndentationOrBeginning>.  It
;; provides commands for moving to the beginning/end of code or line.

;; To install the package manually, add the following to your init file:
;;
;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/mwim-dir")
;;   (autoload 'mwim-beginning-of-code-or-line "mwim" nil t)
;;   (autoload 'mwim-beginning-of-line-or-code "mwim" nil t)
;;   (autoload 'mwim-end-of-code-or-line "mwim" nil t)
;;   (autoload 'mwim-end-of-line-or-code "mwim" nil t)

;; Then you can bind some keys to some of those commands and start
;; moving.
