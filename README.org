** About

This Emacs package provides commands for moving to the beginning/end of
code or line.  It is inspired by [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BackToIndentationOrBeginning][this EmacsWiki page]] (some code from
this page is used).  =mwim= stands for =Move Where I Mean=.

[[https://raw.github.com/alezost/mwim.el/master/demo.gif]]

** Installation

*** Automatic

This package can be installed from [[http://melpa.org/][MELPA]] (with =M-x package-install= or
=M-x list-packages=).

*** Manual

For the manual installation, clone the repo, add the directory to
=load-path= and add autoloads for the commands for moving:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/mwim-dir")
(autoload 'mwim-beginning-of-code-or-line "mwim" nil t)
(autoload 'mwim-beginning-of-line-or-code "mwim" nil t)
(autoload 'mwim-end-of-code-or-line "mwim" nil t)
(autoload 'mwim-end-of-line-or-code "mwim" nil t)
#+END_SRC

** Usage

As you can see in the gif demonstration:

- =M-x mwim-beginning-of-code-or-line= moves the point between a first
  non-space character and a first character of the line.

- =M-x mwim-end-of-code-or-line= moves the point between the end of code
  (not counting a trailing comment) and the end of the line.

=M-x mwim-beginning-of-line-or-code= and =M-x mwim-end-of-line-or-code=
do the same but in a reverse order.

You may bind some keys to some of those commands in a usual manner, for
example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-a") 'mwim-beginning-of-code-or-line)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-e") 'mwim-end-of-code-or-line)
#+END_SRC
