* About

This Emacs package provides several commands to switch between various
line positions, like moving to the beginning/end of code, line or
comment.  It is inspired by [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BackToIndentationOrBeginning][this EmacsWiki page]] (some code from this
page is used).  =mwim= stands for =Move Where I Mean=.

* Installation

** Automatic

This package can be installed from [[http://melpa.org/][MELPA]] (with =M-x package-install= or
=M-x list-packages=).

** Manual

For the manual installation, clone the repo, add the directory to
=load-path= and add autoloads for the commands you need:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/mwim-dir")
(autoload 'mwim "mwim" nil t)
(autoload 'mwim-beginning "mwim" nil t)
(autoload 'mwim-end "mwim" nil t)
(autoload 'mwim-beginning-of-code-or-line "mwim" nil t)
(autoload 'mwim-beginning-of-line-or-code "mwim" nil t)
(autoload 'mwim-beginning-of-code-or-line-or-comment "mwim" nil t)
(autoload 'mwim-end-of-code-or-line "mwim" nil t)
(autoload 'mwim-end-of-line-or-code "mwim" nil t)
#+END_SRC

* Usage

** Simple commands

As you can see in the gif demonstration:

- =M-x mwim-beginning-of-code-or-line= moves the point between a first
  non-space character and a first character of the line.

- =M-x mwim-end-of-code-or-line= moves the point between the end of code
  (not counting a trailing comment) and the end of the line.

=M-x mwim-beginning-of-line-or-code= and =M-x mwim-end-of-line-or-code=
do the same but in a reverse order.

Also there is =M-x mwim-beginning-of-code-or-line-or-comment= command
that switches the point between these 3 positions.

You may bind some keys to some of those commands in a usual manner, for
example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-a") 'mwim-beginning-of-code-or-line)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-e") 'mwim-end-of-code-or-line)
(global-set-key (kbd "<home>") 'mwim-beginning-of-line-or-code)
(global-set-key (kbd "<end>") 'mwim-end-of-line-or-code)
#+END_SRC

Note that =shift-selection= is supported by all MWIM commands, which
means if you press =Shift= with the bound keys (for example,
=<S-home>=), the region of text will be selected (see [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shift-Selection.html#Shift-Selection][Emacs manual]] for
details).

** Move where you really want

Along with the described simple commands, there are more general =M-x
mwim-beginning= and =M-x mwim-end= commands, that allow you to switch
between any positions you want.  By default, they do the same as
=mwim-beginning-of-code-or-line-or-comment= and
=mwim-end-of-code-or-line=, however you can configure switching
positions for these commands with =mwim-beginning-position-functions=
and =mwim-end-position-functions= variables.

And if you wish to use a single key to switch between all these
positions, you can use =M-x mwim= command (controlled by
=mwim-position-functions= variable).

The position functions from the mentioned variables variables are called
without arguments and they should return a new point position.  For
example, after:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq mwim-beginning-position-functions
      (list (lambda () (+ 2 (line-beginning-position)))
            'mwim-code-beginning))
#+END_SRC

=M-x mwim-beginning= will switch between the third character (the second
counting from 0) on the current line and the code beginning position.

You can also make mode-specific positions by making these variables
local.  Let's say, for =emacs-lisp-mode=, you want a usual switch
between the code end and line end when you call =M-x mwim-end=; but if
there is a comment on the current line, you want to move to the
beginning of this comment instead of the code end position.  You can do
it like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun my/comment-beginning-or-code-end ()
  (or (mwim-line-comment-beginning)
      (mwim-code-end)))

(defun my/setup-elisp-mwim-positions ()
  (setq-local mwim-end-position-functions
              '(my/comment-beginning-or-code-end
                mwim-line-end)))

(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'my/setup-elisp-mwim-positions)
#+END_SRC

So, if you want to use these commands instead of the Emacs defaults, you
can bind them like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "<C-tab>") #'mwim)
(global-set-key [remap move-beginning-of-line] #'mwim-beginning)
(global-set-key [remap move-end-of-line] #'mwim-end)
#+END_SRC

** Define your own commands

Finally, you can define your own commands using
=mwim-move-to-next-position= macro.  See the code of =mwim=,
=mwim-beginning= or =mwim-end= commands for examples.

similar facilities as =mwim.el=.  Several ideas were taken from it.
