* About

This Emacs package provides commands for moving to the beginning/end of
code, line or comment.  It is inspired by [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BackToIndentationOrBeginning][this EmacsWiki page]] (some code
from this page is used).  =mwim= stands for =Move Where I Mean=.

* Installation

** Automatic

This package can be installed from [[http://melpa.org/][MELPA]] (with =M-x package-install= or
=M-x list-packages=).

** Manual

For the manual installation, clone the repo, add the directory to
=load-path= and add autoloads for the commands for moving:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/mwim-dir")
(autoload 'mwim-beginning-of-code-or-line "mwim" nil t)
(autoload 'mwim-beginning-of-line-or-code "mwim" nil t)
(autoload 'mwim-beginning-of-code-or-line-or-comment "mwim" nil t)
(autoload 'mwim-end-of-code-or-line "mwim" nil t)
(autoload 'mwim-end-of-line-or-code "mwim" nil t)
#+END_SRC

* Usage

As you can see in the gif demonstration:

- =M-x mwim-beginning-of-code-or-line= moves the point between a first
  non-space character and a first character of the line.

- =M-x mwim-end-of-code-or-line= moves the point between the end of code
  (not counting a trailing comment) and the end of the line.

=M-x mwim-beginning-of-line-or-code= and =M-x mwim-end-of-line-or-code=
do the same but in a reverse order.

Also there is =M-x mwim-beginning-of-code-or-line-or-comment= command
that switches the point between these 3 positions.

You may bind some keys to some of those commands in a usual manner, for
example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key [remap move-beginning-of-line] #'mwim-beginning-of-code-or-line)
(global-set-key [remap move-end-of-line] #'mwim-end-of-code-or-line)
#+END_SRC

or:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-a") 'mwim-beginning-of-code-or-line)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-e") 'mwim-end-of-code-or-line)
(global-set-key (kbd "<home>") 'mwim-beginning-of-line-or-code)
(global-set-key (kbd "<end>") 'mwim-end-of-line-or-code)
#+END_SRC

Note that =shift-selection= is supported by all MWIM commands, which
means if you press =Shift= with the bound keys (for example,
=<S-home>=), the region of text will be selected (see [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shift-Selection.html#Shift-Selection][Emacs manual]] for
details).
